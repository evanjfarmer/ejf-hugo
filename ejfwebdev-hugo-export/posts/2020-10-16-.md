SiteGround

My first real experience with any web hosting solution was with the service-oriented Bulgarian comapany known as SiteGround. This company has really made a name for itself within the WordPress community, giving away 1-year hosting packages at WordCamps and offering WP specific services.

A friend of mine, named Joel Worsham, won a free year of SiteGround hosting at WordCamp US 2015, and was kind enough to pay it forward to me. This allowed me to learn some server side tools and get better acquainted with cPanel, FTP, databases, and site migrations.
