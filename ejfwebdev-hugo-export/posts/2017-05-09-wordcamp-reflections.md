WordCamps are tech-oriented gatherings for people who like to learn, hang out and share ideas, and discover new tools for web hosting, blogging, internet marketing, graphic design and coding. These events are specifically focused on the content management system (CMS) and blogging platform that many know and love, as WordPress. And these casual tech conferences happen in cities all around the world.

There are several [WordCamps][1] around the state of Michigan, and this year many of the folks who have been involved in the Jackson and Ann Arbor monthly [WordPress Meetup][2] groups launched the very first [WordCamp Jackson][3]. WordCamp Ann Arbor has been going strong since the [2014 inaugural event][4], and 2017 will undoubtedly be a great time, so you should definitely check it out!

I&#8217;ve helped out with WCA2 over the past few years and I had the privilege of serving as Sponsorship Wrangler for this first ever WCJXN, which just happened on _May 5th and 6th_. Planning is now underway for WCA2 2017, and if you&#8217;re interested in going to that one, there&#8217;s already aÂ [great looking site][5] up with more details.

WordCamp Jackson was a great experience for me, and I was glad to be a part of organizing the first one to happen in my home town. I plan to start attending more WordCamps as often as I can, because not only are they fun and educational, they also inspire me to challenge myself, level up my skills, publish, and create.

If you&#8217;re into web development, design, marketing, technology or entrepreneurship, you should definitely find a WordPress Meetup or WordCamp in your area!
